            <h1>Design</h1>
            
            <p>Being a design company allows Kartell to express its creativity on multiple fronts. The commitment is to look to the long term and to design and produce objects that will not suffer from the passage of time. Pursuing creativity is the choice of the company to be able to work on different materials without preclusions. This happens if the design is original, the result of a creative process that takes shape in constant dialogue, free from influence, between the entrepreneur and the designer. It is a refined relationship in which creative thought stems from the business know-how, transforming and being shaped into an object.</p>

            <h1>Beauty</h1>
            
            <p>The economy of beauty takes Kartell into the future with the ability to draw on Italy’s unrivalled cultural heritage and translate it into objects that are beautiful and sustainable. The company’s ambition is to make beauty sustainable. Beauty also demands an appropriate arrangement of furnishings in our points of sale.  Beauty is key to the way we communicate, and to how we create window displays and dialogue (directly or digitally) with our customers, in short, to the way we present the world of Kartell. Beauty can assume many forms: an event, a book, a conference, a major international event, Salone del Mobile with its tradition and excitement, an exclusive setting in special places across the world. Kartell is an ambassador for beauty and is committed to continuing to preserve it and make it available to as many people as possible.</p>

            <h1>Sustainability</h1>
            
            <p>It is a continuously evolving concept. Everything that is done today 
                and that comes from the past must be sustainable. There is no other way. This is the route that Kartell has taken, starting from compliance with objectives in the design phase of every new product. Namely to respect the commitment defined in the manifesto “Kartell loves the planet”,
                progressively continuing to improve the results in the various areas of action from the product to organisational management, finance and social.As always, the materials are the very heart of the sustainable evolution  process. The leading role is today played by recycled material, in its Polypropylene, ABS and PMMA versions, derived from pure industrial waste, wood from certified forests, bio materials derived from agricultural waste, polycarbonate 2.0 that generates green transparency from paper and cellulose waste, ceramics and fabrics using recycled materials through to 
                bio finishings containing now chemical solvents. Sustainability is also, however, attention to the details, on which Kartell strives to achieve UN goals. In each and every present and future action, Kartell aims to be a virtuous circular economy model.</p>

            <h1>Quality</h1>
            
            <p>Product quality, production controls and after-sales assistance are the elements that distinguish the original from the copy. The success of Kartell products has often given rise to counterfeits and imitations. The company therefore needs to be rigorous in guaranteeing total originality and excellent quality throughout the supply chain, from design to production, promotion, and sale. Excellent relations with end customers is ensured by our ability to communicate and to excite others by relating the genesis and value of our product. The quality is also guaranteed by the certifications for the different types of products and production processes: from UNI standards for product strength and durability or Greenguard attesting low CO2 emissions in indoor spaces, through to the upstream certification of raw materials that have, in turn, already been certified with respect to origin, such as FSC wood or the synthesis process.</div>
