        <h1>Kartell A. Celebration @ Kartell Museum</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
        Looking to the future starting from fixed points. Kartell Museo presents "Kartell. A CELEBRATION" the special display dedicated to six important anniversaries of the brand. A journey that, through author illustrations, tells the characters and stories of six of Kartell's best-known bestsellers: Gancio, Invisible Table, Louis Ghost, Portariviste, Audrey and FL / Y, which marked the restart of the Lighting division . Objects on display and anniversaries: 50th anniversary Hook: The stable, the one you can always count on The hook hangs on the wall and holds a lot of weight, works well for any type of jacket or coat and with its wider upper part, it holds any type of shoulder strap. So you can always count on him ... Magazine rack: The traveler, the one who always travels The magazine rack is the traveler because with the magazines it contains he takes us all over the world and because he has the handle and therefore lets himself be moved and moved. 20th anniversary Fl / y: The eccentric, the one who makes herself look The first lamp of the new Kartell Lights division, colored but transparent, bearer of an aesthetic that has become a language, where color and light are one and capture everyone's gaze. Louis Ghost: The casual one, the one who knows how to be in any environment The small armchair represents the transparency par excellence, that of his Luigi style that refers to a bourgeois environment, in contrast with the modern taste of the material, makes it suitable for every environment. 10th anniversary Audrey: The quick-change one, the one that always changes Conceived to be able to adapt to the user's taste and to multiple contexts, equipped with backrests and seats upholstered with different fabrics or plastic, the armchair is suitable for all uses. Invisible table: The hospitable, the one that welcomes everyone. The table is the primary piece of furniture par excellence, the heart of the house around which everyone stands. The Yoshioka table takes up the archetype of the table, only one top and four legs without decorative elements, the more rigid formal purity is emphasized by transparency.
