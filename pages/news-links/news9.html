        <h1>Masters: new artists' variations for a charity auction</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            In Montpellier, the Masters chair by Kartell is the star of an exclusive charity initiative to fund the projects of Fonds Guilhem, aimed at improving hospitality and hospitalisation services for inpatient children, and those of AMPA, the Monegasque Association for research on Alzheimer’s disease. Once again, Kartell draws inspiration from the world of art and brings back into play one of its most successful icons in order to give it a brand new look, making it the star of a major artistic event in which design contributes to solidarity projects. The icon created by Philippe Starck and Eugeni Quitllet has been reinterpreted by influential French and international artists, designers and architects, including Camille Adra, Bault, Jérôme Brunet, Talou Coron, Jean Denant, Jacques Ferrier, François Fontès, Thibault Franc, Edouard François, Adrien Fregosi, Emmanuel Gallina, Marie Havel, Rosario Heins, Xavier Llongueras, Tristan Lohner, Manal Rachdi, Jean-Marie Massaud, Ganaëlle Maury, Patrick Norguet, Jean Nouvel, Clément Philippe, Christophe Pillet, Polar, Eugeni Quitllet, Rudy Ricciotti, Michel Soubeyrand, Philippe Starck, Stéphanie Titus, Christina Tsantekidou and Denis Valode. The event is organised by HELENIS and RBC (two leading French companies in the field of design, the first specialising in the supply of habitat solutions for private and public spaces, and the second in developing projects combining art and design) in cooperation with Artcurial, an international auction house specialising in design. The works will be on display for the public to see until 7 February at RBC’s premises in Montpellier and will be auctioned on Thursday 8 February.
