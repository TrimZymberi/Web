        <h1>Kartell Outdoor & Louis Ghost 20th Anniversary at Kartell Flagship Store Paris</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            To coincide with the Maison et Objet show, Kartell’s flagship store in Paris is being transformed into a greenhouse full of ideas for outdoor living in the coming summer season. In settings featuring colours and graphics inspired by nature and open-air life, the unique style of Kartell is creating spaces with a versatile, contemporary, fluid yet characteristic feel. Making its début in Paris is the new HIRAY collection by Ludovica+Roberto Palomba, produced using welded wire techniques. The result is an essential and functional product that is nevertheless rich in emotion. Metal wires form the well-defined yet lightweight structural parts of the collection’s chair, chair with arms, bistro table, armchair, divan and side table. The 20th anniversary of the Louis Ghost chair makes this appointment even more exciting. Consecrated at La Scala in Milan with “Marie Antoinette reloaded”, a pas de deux created by Patrick de Bana and immortalized by Aksinja Bellone in the short film “Louis Ghost on stage”, Wednesday January 18 the Kartell Flagship store in Paris was transformed into a real theater with a screening of the short film “Louis Ghost on stage” and reading “I am Louis Ghost” narrated by actress Constance Arnoult.
