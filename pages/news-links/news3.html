        <h1>Kartell Flagship Store Opening on Miami</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The bright Florida sun gleams through the windows of the new Kartell Flagship store in Miami, looking out onto the charming Coral Gables district. Located at 490 Biltmore Way, the flagship lives amongst the picturesque, Mediterranean-style streets, situated just a few blocks from Miracle Mile – one of the city’s main shopping areas. The store, spanning over 5,300 sf, presents like a promenade of product displays, with the primary focus being outdoor items – amongst which the HIRAY collection by Ludovica+Roberto Palomba catches the eye. The displays also present various ways in which to combine new products with the brand’s most iconic pieces, offering a complete overview of the different indoor and outdoor furnishing options and combinations offered by Kartell. The opening of the Flagship store in Miami, scheduled for November 30th, is part of the Miami’s Art Basel calendar and will be preceded by a special discussion with Roberto Palomba, in which the designer will give his vision of contemporary living. He will be joined by The Grand Tourist’s podcaster, Dan Rubinstein.
