        <h1>Kartell and Teatro alla Scala</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The premiere of La Scala on 7 December celebrates Milan with the highest artistic and musical representation and Kartell announces its support at the Teatro alla Scala for the 2021/2022 season as a technical partner. â€œAn act of love for La Scala - declares Claudio Luti, president of Kartell - which for us means being ambassadors of beauty and culture in the world, together with and alongside the most authoritative institution of art and innovation in the city. Symbol of Milan, the Teatro alla Scala is at the same time a synthesis of tradition and internationalization, just like Kartell. The collaboration between the brand and the theater, which will run throughout the season, will be an opportunity to once again highlight the union between excellences that support the idea of the culture of beauty. It will be a technical partnership that will unfold throughout the season with various moments of communication.
