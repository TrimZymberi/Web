        <h1>Kartell Flagship Store Opening on Genova</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The Kartell retail network sails towards new ports landing for the first time in Genoa, a further step in the expansion strategy of the brand's stores in Italy. The opening allows Kartell to reach its customers in a more capillary way, allowing them to experience the Kartell experience in an immersive way within their own store, to touch the beauty and quality imbued with design of its products. The new Kartell Flagship Store opens its windows in XXV Aprile street, one of the most renowned streets in the Ligurian capital with its elegant 19th-century buildings, an ideal area for those looking for the best luxury shopping brands or for those who prefer sophisticated boutiques. The rational environments softened by arches and granite columns welcome all the latest innovations presented at the Salone del Mobile in June which mix with the products that have by now become a design must-have. From the latest collections that have just entered the catalogue, passing through those that are the standard-bearer of Kartell sustainability for the use of innovative, recyclable and eco-friendly materials up to the world of increasingly numerous and original lights. The Kartell Flagship Store in Genoa is the new design address where you can find the most diverse furnishing solutions united by the constant search for technology and new materials and by Kartell's ability to know how to evolve and innovate.
