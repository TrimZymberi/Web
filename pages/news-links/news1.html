        <h1>Kartell Flagship Store Opening on Wien</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Vienna welcomes the new Kartell Flagship Store in the Central Belvedere District, an area that in recent years has been the subject of an important urban plan, which has now become one of the beating hearts of the Austrian capital. The shop, near the Central Station, is a modern space of 130 square meters that dialogues with the contemporary architecture of the area and presents all the latest innovations seen at the Salone del Mobile last June and the products that have marked the history of the brand. The spaces are a representation of Kartell's identity, enclosed in different product concepts which, in their decline, illustrate the most varied and transversal furnishing solutions with ever-changing moods. Kartell returns to Vienna with an important space, a new showcase in which to show not only its products but its ability to know how to evolve by innovating through constant technological research and continuous research on green and new generation materials, simultaneously showing its heritage of beauty which is also one of the key words that distinguish Kartell together with Design, Innovation, Industrial Production, Quality and Sustainability which are the founding features of the brand.
