        <h1>Kartell fills the main window at Salvioni Milano Durini</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The Kartell and Salvioni brands are both synonymous with premium quality and elegant design. The two have now joined forces for the summer in the main window of the Salvioni Milano Durini concept store, which will be dedicated entirely to Kartell’s outdoor offering and latest arrivals, chosen to offer imaginative solutions for all kinds of spaces and situations. The window will feature a blue sky dotted with fluffy clouds all around, with floor, walls and displays forming an original and exclusive setting inspired by summer and the outdoor life. This new ethereal-pop concept creates the perfect “open air” setting for products designed or customised for enjoying the summer. The mood of the arrangement accurately reflects the philosophy of the 2021 catalogue and leaves plenty of scope for using different layouts for different product families, in all their possible variations. Kartell classics are also mixed with newly launched products in settings that embody to perfection the spirit of Kartell’s new, expanded catalogue. The Glossy Outdoor table by Antonio Citterio is one new idea for the summer, and comes specially finished for life in the open air, with a top in matte porcelain stoneware and a painted steel frame. The table is available in oval and round versions and in white top/white frame, black top/black frame, and aged bronze top/black frame colour combinations. In homage to nature and lightness, the window also features the new ADAM WOOD bookcase by Philippe Starck, with curved wooden shelves and an essential, painted steel frame. The bookcase can be arranged in various ways. Modules can be installed in line to create extended book storage and meet special requirements, while shelves can be positioned at different heights to create fully customised configurations. Also on view are iconic Kartell products like Componibili, including the version made from recycled material, the Venice Mat and Be Bop chairs, the Cara Outdoor armchair and the KABUKI family of lamps by Ferruccio Laviani, in a version specially made for life outdoors. In addition to the window display, Kartell has set up an artistic installation inside the store, in which photos from the kARTell, 150 items 150 artworks project form an original art gallery that makes the Kartell lifestyle an even more absorbing experience.
