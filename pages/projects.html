                To celebrate its twentieth anniversary, Kartell has chosen a special collaboration with Teatro alla Scala, the iconic Milanese temple of opera and ballet. And it is ballet that provides the opportunity to recount the shared qualities of a pas de deux and the line designed by the chair, namely lightness, perfection, elegance and style.

                A veritable universe that draws visitors into a sort of story hovering between the real world and a dreamlike state, precisely because it is such a unique and colourful world, which is why the decision was taken to call it “Kartell Land” curated by Ferruccio Laviani, spread across two floors of the museum, covering an area of some 1500 m².
